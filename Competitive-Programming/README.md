## Update

- I've started a couple of things to learn "Efficient C++" and it's Design Patterns. I'll be following following books and resources:
    - Coding Blocks C++ Course.
    - More Effective C++ by Scott Meyers (more advanced) 

- I'll be maintaining `CMakeLists.txt` for each Challenge and Codes. Trying to follow and learn CMake while going through the resources.
